# SALVO MVH Project Checkpoint & Session Summary

**Date:** 23rd July 2025  
**Objective:** Complete Task 1 (Data Collection Infrastructure) and Task 2 (100k Cartpole Dataset Generation) for the SALVO MVH experiment - testing whether Vision Language Model (VLM) perceptual understanding can replace explicit physical state information in control tasks.

**Status:** COMPLETE. Both tasks successfully executed with working Modal deployment and 100k frame dataset collected.

## Session Log

### **Task 1: Data Collection Infrastructure Setup**

#### **Arc 1: Initial Setup and Code Organization**
- **Challenge:** Claude initially attempted to convert text-based code references into separate files rather than using direct URL references
- **Intervention:** Redirected to use URL references directly, which proved more efficient
- **Resolution:** Established pattern of referencing external codebases via URLs when needed

#### **Arc 2: Modal Environment Configuration** 
- **Challenge:** Multiple Modal deployment issues including:
  - SharedVolume configuration errors
  - Library dependency conflicts with dm_control.suite.gym
  - Confusion between local vs Modal execution environments
- **Key Learning:** Modal documentation reference was critical - had to provide direct link to https://modal.com/docs/guide/project-structure
- **Resolution:** Established clear Modal app structure with proper image definition and volume mounting

#### **Arc 3: Rendering Infrastructure Challenges**
- **Major Challenge:** GLFW/OpenGL rendering failures in headless environment
  - Initial attempts at xvfb virtual display setup failed
  - Serverless rendering proved too slow and unreliable
- **Critical Resolution:** **GPU allocation solved all rendering issues**
  - GPU provides proper OpenGL/EGL support
  - Dramatically improved rendering performance
  - Eliminated need for complex xvfb workarounds
- **Technical Insight:** GPU requirement is essential for reliable dm_control rendering in cloud environments

#### **Arc 4: Data Generation Implementation**
- **Challenge:** DM Control state/action object handling - needed to understand dictionary structure return patterns
- **Solution:** Implemented proper data extraction focusing on:
  - 64x64 pixel observations (images)
  - Actions (continuous control values)
  - Rewards (environment feedback)
  - Terminal states (episode boundaries)

### **Task 2: Dataset Collection and Validation**

#### **Arc 5: Dataset Structure Decisions**
- **Key Question:** Whether to include position/velocity state data alongside images
- **Research Finding:** Position/velocity data is **NOT needed** for either:
  - **SALVO experiment:** Vision-only approach specifically tests VLM perceptual understanding as replacement for explicit state
  - **Dreamer baseline:** Designed to learn latent representations from images/actions, capturing physics implicitly
- **Final Dataset Structure:** Images (64x64), actions, rewards, terminals - confirmed sufficient for both experimental tracks

#### **Arc 6: Data Quality Validation**
- **Implementation:** Added sampling function to visualize random dataset frames
- **Validation Features:**
  - Individual frame analysis with state information overlay
  - Consecutive frame sequences showing actionâ†’reward relationships
  - Grid visualization for quick comparison
- **Quality Confirmed:** Successfully demonstrated cartpole dynamics with action ranges [-1.0, 1.0] and appropriate reward patterns

#### **Arc 7: Technical Insights and Floating-Point Precision**
- **Observation:** Reward calculation discrepancies due to floating-point precision
  - Displayed: 0.003 + 0.003 + 0.002 + 0.002 + 0.001 = 0.011
  - Actual: 0.0115 (higher precision values)
- **Learning:** Standard floating-point arithmetic considerations for data analysis

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Modal Deployment Pipeline:** Fully functional cloud-based data collection with GPU support
2. **Rendering Solution:** GPU-accelerated dm_control environment rendering
3. **Dataset Generation:** 100k frame cartpole-swingup dataset with random policy
4. **Data Validation:** Sampling and visualization tools for quality verification
5. **Architecture Decision:** Vision-only dataset structure confirmed appropriate for both SALVO and Dreamer experiments

## Critical Learning Points

1. **GPU Requirement:** Essential for reliable cloud-based environment rendering
2. **Modal Best Practices:** Direct URL references more efficient than file conversion, proper documentation consultation critical
3. **Dataset Scope:** Vision-only approach validated - position/velocity data would contradict experimental objectives
4. **Checkpointing Need:** Data collection tasks benefit from checkpoint/resume capabilities
5. **Logging Importance:** Comprehensive logging essential for debugging cloud deployment issues

## Next Steps

- **Task 3:** SALVO implementation using collected dataset
- **Task 4:** Dreamer baseline training for comparison
- **Infrastructure:** Dataset remains in Modal storage, ready for training phases

## Repository State

- **Core Files:** `run.py` (Modal app), `src/data_generation.py` (collection logic)
- **Dataset:** 100k frames stored in Modal volume `mvh-salvo-mini-outputs`
- **Dreamer Reference:** Available via text-based code references
- **Documentation:** Session logs and task tracking maintained
